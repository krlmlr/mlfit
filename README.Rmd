Implementation of algorithms that extend Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) to nested structures.

The IPF algorithm operates on count data. This package offers implementations for several algorithms that extend this to nested structures: "parent" and "child" items for both of which constraints can be provided.

## Installation

Install from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("mlfit")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mlfit/mlfit")
```

## Example - single zone

Here is a multi-level fitting example with a reference sample (`reference_sample`) and two control tables (`individual_control` and `group_control`). Each row of `reference_sample` represents an individual in a sample of a population, where `HHNR` is their group ID and `PNR` is their individual ID, `APER` and `WKSTAT` are individial-level charateristics, and `CAR` is the only household characteristic of the sample population. The 'N' columns in both control tables denote how many units of individuals or groups belong to each category.

```{r}
library(mlfit)
library(tibble)

reference_sample <- tibble::tribble(
  ~HHNR, ~PNR, ~APER, ~CAR, ~WKSTAT,
     1L,   1L,    3L,  "0",     "1",
     1L,   2L,    3L,  "0",     "2",
     1L,   3L,    3L,  "0",     "3",
     2L,   4L,    2L,  "0",     "1",
     2L,   5L,    2L,  "0",     "3",
     3L,   6L,    3L,  "0",     "1",
     3L,   7L,    3L,  "0",     "1",
     3L,   8L,    3L,  "0",     "2",
     4L,   9L,    3L,  "1",     "1",
     4L,  10L,    3L,  "1",     "3",
     4L,  11L,    3L,  "1",     "3",
     5L,  12L,    3L,  "1",     "2",
     5L,  13L,    3L,  "1",     "2",
     5L,  14L,    3L,  "1",     "3",
     6L,  15L,    2L,  "1",     "1",
     6L,  16L,    2L,  "1",     "2",
     7L,  17L,    5L,  "1",     "1",
     7L,  18L,    5L,  "1",     "1",
     7L,  19L,    5L,  "1",     "2",
     7L,  20L,    5L,  "1",     "3",
     7L,  21L,    5L,  "1",     "3",
     8L,  22L,    2L,  "1",     "1",
     8L,  23L,    2L,  "1",     "2"
  )

individual_control <- tibble::tribble(
  ~WKSTAT,   ~N,
      "1",  91L,
      "2",  65L,
      "3", 104L
  )

group_control <- tibble::tribble(
  ~CAR,  ~N,
   "0", 35L,
   "1", 65L
  )
```

First we need to create a `ml_problem` object which defines our multi-level fitting problem. `special_field_names()` is useful for the `field_names` argument to `ml_problem()`, this is where we need to specific the names of the ID columns in our reference sample and the count column in the control tables.

```{r}
fitting_problem <- ml_problem(
  ref_sample = reference_sample, 
  controls = list(
    individual = list(individual_control),
    group = list(group_control)
  ),
  field_names = special_field_names(
    groupId = "HHNR", 
    individualId = "PNR", 
    count = "N"
  )
)
```

You can use one of the `ml_fit_*()` functions to calibrate your fitting problem, or you can use `ml_fit(ml_problem, algorithm = "<your-selected-algorithm>")`.

```{r}
fit <- ml_fit(ml_problem = fitting_problem, algorithm = "ipu")
fit
```

`mlfit` also provides a function that helps to replicate the reference sample based on the fitted/calibrated weights. See `?ml_replicate` to find out which integerisation algorithms are available.

```{r}
syn_pop <- ml_replicate(fit, algorithm = "trs")
syn_pop
```

## Example - multiple zones

This example is almost identical to the previous example, except we are creating sub-fitting problems based on zones. `ml_problem()` has the `geo_hierarchy` argument, where it lets you specify a geographical hierarchy, a `data.frame` with two columns: `region` and `zone`. To put it simply, a zone can only belong to one region. The image below shows an example of that, where the orange patch is a zone that is within the green region.

When `geo_hierarchy` is validly specified, `ml_problem()` would return a list of fitting problems, one fitting problem per zone. Each fitting problem will contain only relevant subsets of the reference sample and control totals for its zone. Basically, the reference sample is a population survey sample taken at a regional level and the control totals should be at a zonal level.  

```{r}
ref_sample <- tibble::tribble(
  ~HHNR, ~PNR, ~APER, ~HH_VAR, ~P_VAR, ~REGION,
      1,    1,     3,       1,      1,       1,

### Where is `MultiLeveLIPF`?

From version `0.4.0` onwards the package is now to be known as `mlfit`. If you would like to install any version that is older than `0.4.0` please use:

``` r
# See https://github.com/mlfit/mlfit/releases for the releases that are available
# To install a certain branch or commit or tag, append it to the repo name, after an @:
devtools::install_github("mlfit/mlfit@v0.3-7")
```

Note that, all versions prior to `0.4.0` should be used as `MultiLeveLIPF` not `mlfit`.
