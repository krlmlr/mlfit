## Bug fixes

### ml_replicate

- Getting a replication algorithm now guarantee to wâ€¦ (#81).


# mlfit 0.6.1 (2023-02-09)

- Fixed the internal working of `ml_replicate()`. Getting a replication algorithm now is guaranteed to work even without the mlfit package in the current environment. This can be an fatal issue when mlfit is internally called by another package. The root cause of this is in the .get_int_fnc() that uses as.environment("package:mlfit").


# mlfit 0.6.0.9001 (2023-02-02)

## Chore

- Styler.


# mlfit 0.6.0 (2023-02-01)

- Soft deprecated the `prior_weights` argument. The name of a weight column in the reference sample to be used as prior weights should be specified using the `prior_weight` argument in `special_field_names()`.
- the `group_controls` and `individual_controls` arguments of `ml_problem()` now have `NULL` as their default value.
- Fixed `ml_problem()` not allowing single-level control when the `geo_hierarchy` argument is not `NULL`. (#78, @walkerke)
- It is now possible to use prior weights in a `geo_hierarchy` `ml_problem()`. Simply specify the name of the weight column in your reference sample using the `prior_weight` argument in `special_field_names()`. (#78, @walkerke)

- Status messages with `verbose = TRUE` are prepended with a time stamp.
- Fail if `NA` group ID found.


# mlfit 0.3-2 (2016-04-25)

- Reorganized and renamed internal datasets.


# mlfit 0.3-1 (2016-04-17)

- Fitting result contains `iterations` and `tol` members (#28).
- Fixed model matrix of "separate" type if only grand totals are given.
- `ml_fit()` gains `tol` argument, which determines the success of a fitting operation.
- `ml_fit` objects have new members `success`, `rel_residuals`, and `flat_weighted_values` (#28).
- HIPF and IPU stop iterating if tolerance is reached.
- IPU and HIPF abort iteration when the weights do not change measurably between two iterations (#27).


# mlfit 0.3 (2016-04-14)

- Features
    - New algoritms: HIPF (#2) and IPU.

- Interface
    - New `as.flat_ml_fit_problem()` is used to coerce input for the `ml_fit_` functions.
    - `format()` and `print()` methods for classes `fitting_problem`, `flat_ml_fit_problem` and `ml_fit`.
    - Flattened reference sample now contains observations in rows, and controls in columns (#26).
    - `flatten_ml_fit_problem()` gains new `model_matrix_type` argument that allows selecting an alternative model matrix building method where all cross-classifications are allocated to a column, regardless of overlaps. Flattened problems store the type of model matrix used, it is also shown with the `format()` and `print()` methods.

- Improvements
    - Reference sample doesn't need to be ordered by group ID anymore.
    - Remove `individualsPerGroup` special variable.
    - Allow problems with individual-only controls.
    - Check for correspondence of levels between sample and controls.
    - Check for `NA` values in controls.

- Technical changes
    - Use `grake` package again for calibration, because the alternatives are worse: `sampling` uses a too low tolerance, `survey` forcibly loads `MASS`, and `laeken` could work but is unrelated (which is the reason `grake` has been started in the first place).
    - Duplicate rows are kept in the reference sample.
    - Rename `control_totals` to `target_values`.
    - New `toy_example()` allows easier access to bundled examples, load with `readRDS()`.
    - Move legacy format (IPAF) and related functions to `data-raw` directory.
    - Use factors internally.

- Performance
    - Use `dplyr` functions instead of `aggregate()`.

- Tests
    - Specific test for households with the same signature.

- Documentation
    - Enhance example.
    - Include flat example problem (group size = 1 for all groups).

- Cleanup
    - Cleanup and split of `flatten_ml_fit_problem()`.


# mlfit 0.2 (2016-01-30)

- New functions `compute_margins()` and `margins_to_df()` for validation
- Support specification of prior weights in construction of fitting problems
- Use `survey::grake()` instead of `grake::calibWeights()`.
- Adapt to change of undocumented behavior in base R.
- Don't alter column names of controls if they are of type `data.table` (explicitly convert to `data.frame`)
- Proper handling of corner cases (reference sample with one row, and grand total controls and dummy controls with only one category)
- Allow character variables (in addition to factors) as control variables
- Explicit error message if reference sample is not sorted
- If name of count column in controls is not specified, it is determined automatically (with a message in verbose mode)

# mlfit 0.1 (2015-05-26)

- new functions `fitting_problem`, `is.fitting_problem`, `special_field_names`
- all fitting functions now expect an object of class `fitting_problem` (as returned by the `fitting_problem` and `import_IPAF_problem` functions); former calls like `ml_fit(ref_sample, controls, field_names)` now need to be written as `ml_fit(fitting_problem(...))`

# mlfit 0.0-14 (2015-04-15)

- use `grake` package instead of `laeken`
- new argument `ginv` to `ml_fit_dss`, passed down to calibWeights

- fix example for `ml_fit_dss`

# mlfit 0.0-12 (2014-11-21)

- new function `ml_fit_dss` with an implementation very close to the paper by
  Deville et al. (1993); implementation in the `laeken` package

- normalize weights to get rid of precision problems

  Moore-Penrose inverse for our (very special) transformation matrix (#17)

- warn on missing observations for nonzero controls (#20)

- `ml_fit_entropy_o` also returns flat weights

- allow arbitrary order in control total tables (#19)

- remove observations that correspond to zero-valued control totals, with warning;
  don't warn if no corresponding observations need to be removed (#16)

# mlfit 0.0-10 (2014-07-04)

- support multiple controls at individual or group level, also detect conflicting
  control totals

- support fitting one-dimensional problems (where only group-level controls are given)

# mlfit 0.0.9 (2014-06-19)

- new function `flatten_ml_fit_problem`: transform representation as returned
  by `import_IPAF_result` into a matrix, a control vector and a weights vector

- function `ml_fit_entropy_o`: use `BB::dfsane` instead of `BB::BBsolve` for
  solving the optimization problem; rename argument `BBsolve_args` to `dfsane_args`

- function `ml_fit`: new parameter `verbose`

- aggregate identical household types, implement prior weights (so far only
  internally)

# mlfit 0.0.8 (2014-06-17)

- Add example for `ml_fit` (#11)

- allow additional arguments for the algorithms; `ml_fit_entropy_o` now accepts
  a named list `BBsolve_args` that contains additional arguments to `BB::BBsolve`

- Faster internal data preparation for `ml_fit_entropy_o`

# mlfit 0.0.7 (2014-06-17)

- Fix dependency issues (#13, #14)

- Print more helpful error message if control totals and reference sample
  categories do not overlap (#11)

# mlfit 0.0.6 (2014-02-09)

- `import_IPAF_results` now returns a class of type `IPAF_results`
- New functions `ml_ipf` and `ml_ipf_entropy_o`, implementation does not yet
  return the same weights as the Python code
- Convert control columns to factors

# mlfit 0.0.5 (2014-02-07)

- Fix importing configuration files with more than one control of any type
  and with comments in the control definition

- New parameter `config_name` to `import`, defaults to `config.xml`

# mlfit 0.0.4 (2013-12-06)

- Parameter `all_weights` to `import` that allows importing also intermediate
  weights.  The output format of `import` has changed, the weights for each
  algorithm are now always a list of weight vectors, even in the default case
  `all_weights == FALSE` (#5).

# mlfit 0.0.3 (2013-11-28)

- Import results of old Python code (#1).

# mlfit 0.0.2 (2013-11-26)
